Just a simple program in Python 3 to test the Monte Carlo Simulation Model to estimate the number pi (3.14)

The idea is to simulate a large amount of points 'falling' in a square area with sides, for example, 1 meter. In this square there are
a circle circumscribed. Considering that the square have a side of 1 meter we can say that the circle will have a radius of 0.5 meters.
Because we know the area of the square (1x1) and the region of the circle (x²+y² = radius²; center = (0,0)) we can use Python to generate
various random numbers in a domain that corresponds to the area of the square. With this pair of numbers (Xrandom, Yrandom) we can see
if the point analyzed is within the circle or the square and therefore aproximate the number Pi.
